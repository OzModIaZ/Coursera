## Welcome to the School Web Project!

This project is a work in progress aimed at showcasing my web development skills. As a student at Coursera, I am excited to share my journey of learning and growth through this web project. The goal is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing website that reflects my understanding of web development concepts.

Throughout the development process, I will be implementing various features and design elements to enhance the user experience. Please note that since this project is ongoing, you may encounter incomplete sections or placeholders. Your feedback and suggestions are highly valuable as they will contribute to the project's improvement.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project. I look forward to sharing the completed website with you soon!
